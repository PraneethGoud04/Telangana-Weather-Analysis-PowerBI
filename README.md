# Telangana-Weather-Analysis-PowerBI
Power BI project analyzing Telangana weather data (2021–2024) to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and regional variations in rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
# Telangana Weather Data Analysis (2021–2024) 

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical weather data of Telangana from 2021 to 2024 using **Power BI**.  
The objective is to uncover meaningful insights related to **rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed** by leveraging interactive dashboards and data visualization techniques.

---

##  Business Problem
Weather conditions in Telangana vary significantly across districts and seasons.  
Although historical weather data is available, it lacks a centralized and interactive analytical view, making it difficult to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and extreme weather events for data-driven decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze multi-year weather data of Telangana (2021–2024)
- Identify seasonal and yearly trends
- Compare district-wise and mandal-wise variations
- Detect extreme and anomalous weather conditions
- Present insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard

---

## Dataset Description
- **Time Period:** 2021 – 2024  
- **Granularity:** Daily data at district and mandal levels  
- **Weather Parameters:**
  - Rainfall (mm)
  - Minimum & Maximum Temperature (°C)
  - Minimum & Maximum Humidity (%)
  - Minimum & Maximum Wind Speed (kmph)

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Calculated measures
- **CSV / Excel datasets**

---

##  Data Preparation & Modeling
- Combined multiple yearly and monthly CSV files using Power Query
- Created date attributes (Year, Month, Month Number) for time-based analysis
- Built calculated measures for average weather parameters
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies
- Designed a clean and efficient data model for analysis

---

##  Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard consists of multiple pages:
- **Comprehensive Weather Overview**
- **Rainfall Analysis**
- **Temperature Analysis**
- **Humidity Analysis**
- **Wind Speed Analysis**

Interactive slicers allow filtering by **Year, District, and Month**, enabling dynamic exploration of weather patterns.

---

##  Key Insights
- A major portion of annual rainfall (approximately 70–80%) occurs during monsoon months
- Temperature shows strong seasonal patterns with summer peaks
- Humidity levels closely correlate with rainfall trends
- Wind speed exhibits moderate variation with occasional extreme events
- Significant district-wise variability exists across all weather parameters

---

## Project Outcome
This project demonstrates how raw weather data can be transformed into actionable insights using Power BI, supporting:
- Agriculture planning
- Water resource management
- Disaster preparedness
- Regional climate analysis

---

##  Future Scope
- Integration of real-time weather data
- Forecasting using predictive models
- Automated data refresh and alerts
- Advanced anomaly detection

---

##  Files Included
- `PowerBI Final Project.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file
- Weather datasets (CSV / Excel)
- Project documentation (README)
